\t* '-' - The syntax to subtract a number from another number. (5 - 6 = -1)
\t* '+' - The syntax to add a number with another number. (5 + 6 = 11)
\t* '*' (Asterix) - The Syntax to multiply a number by another number. (5 * 6 = 30)
\t* '/' (Forward Slash) - The Syntax to divide a number by another number. 
                          (5 / 6 = 0 [Because its not a float])
\t* '%' (Percent) - The Syntax to display the remainder of a division (11 % 6 = 5) or (3 % 2 = 1)
\t* '<=' - Check if a number is less than or equal to another number (5 <= 6 = True)
\t* '<' - Check if a number is less than another number (5 < 6 = True)
\t* '>=' - Check if a number is greater than or equal to another number (5 >= 6 = False)
\t* '>' - Check if a number is greater than another number (5 > 6 = False)
\t* '==' - Check if a number is equal than another number (5 == 6 = False)
